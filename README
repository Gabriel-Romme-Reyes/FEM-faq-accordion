## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about the difference of inline and block elements in this one because i had a problem when adding the background color yellow on the span at first it was an h4 element but upon adding the background color it took up the whole horizontal margin that is where i learned that h4 is a block element and that is when i switch it to span instead. i also learnt a bit more about css such as box-shadow and indentation.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me for learning more about css such as text indentation,box-shadow, etc. and js code such as the accordion and changing the svg icons
